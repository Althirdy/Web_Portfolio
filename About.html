                    Hi There! I am a Full stack Developer using React as my Front End and using Laravel and
                    CodeIgniter
                    as a Back-End.

                    I have a experience in CodeIgniter. In my past Internship in a start-up company I've used
                    CodeIgniter for that In my almost 6 months of internship I build a full stack application using
                    CodeIgniter and because of that internship I expose in some work things like sprint, tickets and
                    talking to a client.

                    have a good communication skills because in my internship I present the system in front of the
